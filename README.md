# Strategy-Pattern
Software Design and Architecture Strategy Pattern

In this example you are given;
   DriveBehavior interface
   Car abstract class
   Terrain abstract class
 MuddyTerrain and FlatTerrain classes that describes the type of the road.
 
Here's the list of your assignments:
   Using the Car class as a guide, create a class RallyCar for rally cars.
   
 You are expected to implement two types of drive behavior; OnRoadDrive and OffRoadDrive
with respect to Strategy Pattern.
   OnRoadDrive and OffRoadDrive should use drive effciency method of the corresponding Ter-
rains.
You are NOT allowed to alter DriveBehavior, Car, Terrain, MuddyTerrain, and FlatTerrain
classes.

 Measure of success
 
You should print the result of the classification on the console screen
according to the driving effciency of the car.
